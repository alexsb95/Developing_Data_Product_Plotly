## MPG VS Transmition

We show the relationship with the miles per galon and the transmition of the car. 
The 0 is the automatic and 1 is manual.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)


data(mtcars)

plot_ly(mtcars, y = ~mpg, color = ~factor(am), type = "box", boxpoints = "all")
```
