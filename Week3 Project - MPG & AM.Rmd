## Context

We show the relationship with the miles per galon and the transmition of the car. 
The 0 is the automatic and 1 is manual.

```{r data, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)


data(mtcars)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
```

## Plot


```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~am, y = ~mpg, color = ~am, colors = c("#b2e0d2", "#c6cfe5"), type = "box", boxpoints = "all", jitter = 0.4,pointpos = -1.8)

```
